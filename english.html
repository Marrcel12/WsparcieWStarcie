                <div class="col-8">Youth Center (pol. Centrum Młodych) is a facility located on the right bank of Vistula River, in the Prague North district, one of the 3 urban problem zones in the City of Warsaw. The premises owned and maintained by the city host the project Support to Start (pol. Wsparcie w Starcie), a partnership of 8 non-governmental organizations whose activities are dedicated to people aged 16-26 from Prague North, Prague South and Targówek districts. This two-years pilotage which will end on December 2018 was launched thanks to city funds to check new models of support and successful work with young adults.</div>

To do so some of them have to concentrate on establishing psychological and social maturity, others develop abilities to manage their finances or obtain and maintain employment on an open labor market. Therefore the program of Support to Start had to be tailor made to answer a wide range of challenges and needs.</div>
